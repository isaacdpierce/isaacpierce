    <h3>A wee bit about me.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My mother says I'm handsome.</li>
      <li>My doctor says I'm healthy.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend says I'm smart.</li>
      <li>Who am I to argue?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What can I offer?</h3>
    <p>
      The most important part of me I can offer is my passionate desire to be helpful to others. I
      love working with great people and doing great things. I'm a great listener. I'm relentlessly
      creative, curious and hard working. I love pushing myself to master new skills. I love writing
      (especially code) and anything that keeps me creating and learning online. I also have a
      pretty cheeky sense of humour.
